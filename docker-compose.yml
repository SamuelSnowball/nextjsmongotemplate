# This file is for local development use only, in the cloud we use a taskdefinition file

# By default docker compose creates a bridge network and adds all the containers to it.
# mongod is not aware of this network and therefore doesn't bind to that ip. 
# By default, binds only to 127.0.0.1, which means only connections will be allowed
# from within the container.
# So we need to create a static IP for the mongo container and connect to the mongo
# contaier via that IP.
